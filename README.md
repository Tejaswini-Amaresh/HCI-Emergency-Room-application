An Emergency Room application was designed as a part of the Human Computer Interaction course -Sept-Dec 2020
# Grey's ER app - An application to ease out the procedures during emergency situation and provide access to hospital services easily.
We have all been witness to an emergency situation or a victim to one. With covid cases on the rise, on-time emergency aid has become extremely necessary.
With the help of our application , facilities such as accessing nearby hospitals ,their ER wait times are made extremely easy.
Options to pre-fill basic personal details and medical history is provided as to avoid delays in getting access to the treatment.Access to emergency services are provided with the flick of a finger.<br />
The designing of our project involved the following phases.<br/><br/>
1.**Needfinding**: Firstly, we put in all our ideas and came into the conclusion of designing an application which involved providing assistance during an emergency situation.
We created a survey involving 10 people to get their perspective about emergency rooms,their response about an application involving reducing delays in emergency rooms and ideas about features that could be included in the appication.We also interviewed hospital staff, people who had been in an emergency situation and relatives of the patient to get a better understanding of the working of the ER and their experiences in the ER.
We brain-stormed and created empathy maps, userpersonas and a story-board .<br /><br />
2.**Low fidelity prototype**: A paper prototype as well as a lo-fi wireframe prototype involving the rough outline of the application ,along with the features we plan to include was developed.<br />

<br />

3.**High fidelity prototype**: A full fledeged high-fi prototype containing all the application features was developed through Adobe XD.<br />

4.**Concept video** - We created a concept video which involved a simple video explaining the detailed working of the application.<br />
